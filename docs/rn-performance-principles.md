# React Native Performance Principles

- Profile before optimizing—most performance issues originate from JS thread; profile JavaScript first using React DevTools Profiler, Flipper, or why-did-you-render
- Measure before/after when applying any optimization technique—use release mode for accurate metrics (dev mode performance is misleading)
- Prefer bottom-up/atomic state management over top-down cascading patterns
- Use memoized selectors (`createSelector`) when deriving data from global state
- Normalize entity state in Redux using `createEntityAdapter` for O(1) access
- Optimization must be data-driven: measure first, optimize second
- React Native owns the rendering lifecycle; you control composition, not repaints
- Performance problems manifest as UI flicker and FPS drops, especially on low-end devices
- Use `useSelector` hooks over `connect` for simpler usage patterns
- Premature optimization can increase memory usage without measurable benefit
- Bundle size directly impacts TTI: All imported code is loaded, parsed, and executed; Metro doesn't tree-shake
- Layout measurement is the bottleneck: Measuring layout dominates list rendering cost
- Virtualization is mandatory for large lists: FlatList/FlashList only render visible items + buffer
- MUST prioritize based on user paths and business impact
- MUST establish control plan with acceptable ranges and monitoring frequency
- MUST automate regression detection; manual testing doesn't scale
- Render duration and render count are primary React Native performance metrics
- Statistical significance required to validate improvements (environment variation exists)
- Profiling must account for measurement variation (same device, different runs differ)
- MUST detect prewarming before measuring startup time (iOS 15+ ProcessInfo environment variable)
- MUST use System Tracing for thread-level analysis (Android); mqt_js thread saturation indicates JS thread bottleneck
- Consider battery consumption impact in library selection (web libraries cause extraneous CPU/memory consumption; battery drain affects both foreground and background execution)
- OS (iOS) continuously monitors resource consumption and may throttle background activities; background activity intervals can be reduced by OS if resource usage is excessive
- Mobile SDKs deliver performance equivalent to native applications; web libraries assume browser capabilities and constraints, leading to suboptimal mobile performance
- Bridge communication is asynchronous, non-deterministic, and capacity-limited; each bridge call requires JSON serialization/deserialization overhead
- Bridge traffic competes with gestures, animations, and UI updates; bridge has no built-in priority queue, all traffic competes equally
- Busy bridge during gestures/animations causes dropped frames; minimize bridge traffic during active animations
- React Native renderer diffs props and only sends minimal updates over bridge on re-render
- NativeDriver serializes animation once upfront; no bridge traffic during execution (limited to transform/opacity)
- Reanimated worklets run JavaScript synchronously on UI thread (supports layout properties)
- Gesture Handler processes gestures natively, avoiding JS thread entirely
- JS-driven animations cannot achieve consistent 60FPS; prefer native solutions (NativeDriver/Reanimated/Gesture Handler)
- Native modules must be thin wrappers; heavy abstractions belong on JS side
- Validation and type checking must occur before bridge calls to avoid unnecessary round-trips
